60cycleCMS README

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for choosing 60cycleCMS!  This document should help you get 
started.

ABOUT:
60cycleCMS is a simple Content Management System for use on a personal
website.  It was originally written to serve the needs of 60cycle.net,
David van Geest's website.  60cycleCMS uses PHP and MySQL, and is
licensed under the New BSD License (see COPYRIGHT).

INSTALLATION:

PRE-REQUISITIES:
- an Apache (or other server that supports .htaccess and .htpasswd files)
  webserver with PHP installed
- a MySQL server (you will need the username, password, and server address)

OPTIONAL:
- a RECAPTCHA account (private and public key)

STEPS:
1.	Copy the archive to the directory you would like to see your
	blog/news, and unzip (in linux use "unzip 60cycleCMS.2.1.0.zip).
2.	Go to the new private/ directory in your browser.
3.	Click the Install link, follow the directions.

NOTE:  Many users will likely get this message:

**** WARNING: Could not move config.php to one level above website root.  Please do this MANUALLY *****

This is normal (it means that PHP doesn't have write access outside of 
your web directory... which is good).  You will have to move the file yourself.

You could also get the following message:

**** Could not create config.php file! You will have to do this MANUALLY. See common/config.php for a template. ****

This means PHP does not have write access to your website root.

To resolve, copy the example common/config.php to one level above
web root and fill in your information manually.
	
4.	Modify display pages as you wish.  Note that index.php and post.php
	are just bare-bones HTML with two blocks of PHP.  You can copy-paste
	those blocks into an existing website or template.  In the private/
	folder, you can do similar copy-paste with all of the one-word files,
	e.g. index.php, submit.php, edit.php.
	
	Unless you know what you're doing, don't modify news.php,
	printEntries.php, or any of the two-word files in private/.
  
  Update styles as needed in style/style.css.  This file contains all
  the CSS styles used by 60cycleCMS.
  
5.	You're done.

COMMON ISSUES:

The .htaccess and .htpasswd files were created during the install process,
but I still can access private/ without a username or password!

Possible Causes:
- Restart your browser... the info may be cached
- If you're using Apache, you need to have the AllowOverride AuthConfig
  directive in effect
- Your webserver doesn't support .htaccess and .htpasswd (try Apache)

Other problems?  I may or may not be able to help, but I'll probably try.
